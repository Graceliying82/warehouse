# warehouse
Welcome to the warehouse management system prototype code. My name is Grace Li, and I am the owner of this code.

I developed this code as a prototype for a client, and for safety reasons, I created a private repository based on this code. The customer code had since gone through several iterations and refactors and differs significantly from this prototype code.
Please note that this code is only for study purposes. since I did not work on this stream for years, some of the dependencies and libraries may already be out of date.  And I cannot guarantee the code's functionality with the latest versions of these dependencies and libraries.

Thank you for your interest in my work.

Sincerely,

Grace Li
